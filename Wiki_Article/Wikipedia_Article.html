        <hr />

            <p><strong><em>Star Wars</em></strong> (retroactively retitled <strong><em>Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope</em></strong>) is a 1977 American <a href="#">epic</a> <a href="#">space opera</a> film written and directed by <a href="#">George Lucas</a>, produced by <a href="#">Lucasfilm</a> and distributed by <a href="#">20th Century-Fox</a>. It was the first film released in the <a href="#"><em>Star Wars</em></a> film series and the fourth chronological chapter of the "<a href="#">Skywalker Saga</a>". Set "a long time ago" in a <a href="#">fictional universe</a> where the galaxy is ruled by the tyrannical <a href="#">Galactic Empire</a>, the story focuses on a group of <a href="#">freedom fighters</a> known as the <a href="#">Rebel Alliance</a>, who aim to destroy the Empire's newest weapon, the <a href="#">Death Star</a>. When Rebel leader <a href="#">Princess Leia</a> is apprehended by the Empire, <a href="#">Luke Skywalker</a> acquires stolen <a href="#">architectural plans</a> of the Death Star and sets out to rescue her while learning the ways of a metaphysical power known as "<a href="#">the Force</a>" from <a href="#">Jedi Master</a>  <a href="#">Obi-Wan Kenobi</a>. The cast includes <a href="#">Mark Hamill</a>, <a href="#">Harrison Ford</a>, <a href="#">Carrie Fisher</a>, <a href="#">Peter Cushing</a>, <a href="#">Alec Guinness</a>, <a href="#">David Prowse</a>, <a href="#">James Earl Jones</a>, <a href="#">Anthony Daniels</a>, <a href="#">Kenny Baker</a>, and <a href="#">Peter Mayhew</a>.</p>
        
            <p>Lucas had the idea for a science-fiction film in the vein of <a href="#">Flash Gordon</a> around the time he completed his first film, <a href="#">THX 1138</a> (1971), and began working on a treatment after the release of <a href="#">American Graffiti</a> (1973). After numerous rewrites, filming took place throughout 1975 and 1976 in locations including Tunisia and <a href="#">Elstree Studios</a> in <a href="#">Hertfordshire</a>, England. The film suffered production difficulties; the cast and crew involved believed the film would be a failure. Lucas formed the <a href="#">visual effects</a> company <a href="#">Industrial Light & Magic</a> to help create the film's special effects. It also went $3 million over budget due to delays.</P>
